Piece of script to display IRC logs on your webpage in aesthetic way.

Mainly made for my own use but since high demand I decided to finally publish this. Only the recognization of default Irssi log format is quaranteed, but if you have any knowledge of Javascript, the code is really easy to edit to satisfy your needs. In the future I may add better configuration possibilities.
